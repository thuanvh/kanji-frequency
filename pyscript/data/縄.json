  "koohiiStory1": "The tortoise has escaped! We tied it up with a straw rope, but all that´s left of the rope are some torn threads, and the unbound tortoise is nowhere to be found. (Note that the right half here is not \"eels\". This is (in my opinion) a mistake in the RTK book, as we already decided in waterfall (#537) to refer to the simplified form of dragon as \"eels\". It is much better to call the right half of this character an \"unbound tortoise\".).",
  "koohiiStory2": "When Spiderman fights the giant tortoise, he grabs a straw rope from the edges of the sumo ring and swings it at his head. However, the tortoise quickly tucks his head back into his shell to avoid the blow (hence no head on the tortoise).",
