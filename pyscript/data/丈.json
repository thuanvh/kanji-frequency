  "koohiiStory2": "This kanji reminds me of the kanji for big (I think it looks the same kinda of except for the last stroke). Maybe this works for guys, but when you were growing up you would compare \"length\" with your friends trying to show how BIG you were. You wouldn´t show \"it\" but you would spread your arms out as wide as possible to exaggerate your length. Maybe even so wide that you trip (I the 3rd stroke getting pushed over)! I just find it easier to relate this to the previous kanji.",
