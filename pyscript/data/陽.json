  "heisigStory": "Different from the primitive for <i>sun</i> (which figures in the character) and the kanji for <i>ray</i> (Frame 125), the key word <b>sunshine</b> is meant to convey the meaning of the masculine principle in nature, or \"Yang.\" (The dark is viewed mythically as the feminine principle; see frame 1718.) From there it comes to mean <i>sun</i> also. The elements are: <i>pinnacle</i> . . . <i>piggy bank</i>.",
