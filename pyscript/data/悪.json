  "koohiiStory2": "Asian hearts are bad and evil. They invented so much martial arts: karate, judo, kungfu, muay thai, silat, etc... just to hurt each other. They torture their own people (China, North Korea). They torture other people (Japan in China and Korea). And they are able to hide all this behind their nice facade of kindness. Bad, bad Asians. (did i shatter some people´s ideas on Asia? my bad).",
