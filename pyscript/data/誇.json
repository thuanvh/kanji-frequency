  "koohiiStory2": "A dog owner boasts about how obedient, not how smart, his Saint Bernard dog is. \"Why, my dog will even walk right into a trap if I tell him to. Watch!\" With a single word, \"go!\", his dog obediently runs into a snare trap hanging from the ceiling. In a flash, the dog is netted tightly and swinging from the ceiling. Don´t forget the ceiling!",
