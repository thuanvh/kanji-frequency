The <i>water</i> to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the <i>can</i> at the right tells us that our \"little engine that <i>could</i>\" has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat.",

  "koohiiStory2": "I kept confusing this with stream. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial river. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow River in China (黄河), and the other is the Milky Way (銀河).
