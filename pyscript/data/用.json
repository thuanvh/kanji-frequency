  "koohiiStory2": "I´ll confuse this with use (#990), so build a distinction right from the start. For me, \"utilize\" has an artificial, business-speak connotation; you only utilize \"utilize\" when you´re trying to puff up what you´re saying and sound important. So: \"BioTools Inc introduces the FG2000 screwdriver, utilizing the our latest FleshGrip(tm) technology!\" I´m seeing this as a picture of a stubby screwdriver with a handle made of flesh, a short shaft, and prongs to hold a screw in place until you drive it.",
