  "koohiiStory1": "Similar to radical tyro´s story. If you live in Japan, your main exposure to this kanji is probably \"no smoking\" signs. So I imagine the government enacting a prohibition of tobacco, and burning whole groves of tobacco plants on an altar (the altar of public health, or self-righteousness, if you will).",
  "koohiiStory2": "Hidden in a grove was a church with a secret altar that was stocked full of prohibited alcohol during the American prohibition period of 1920-1933. A local registered himself as a mininster of this altar so he could stock prohibited alcohol \"for sacremental purposes\" and share it with his kin (きん).",
