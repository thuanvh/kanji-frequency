  "heisigStory": "<i>Mist</i> . . . <i>umbrella</i> . . . <i>dry</i>. The meaning of this key word extends beyond <b>tree trunks</b> to represent the main stem or line of anything from railway lines to managerial staffs. This should help distinguish it from the stories used earlier for <i>book</i> (Frame 224) and <i>body</i> (Frame 1030), both of which made use of the image of a <b>tree trunk</b>, as well as the kanji for <i>trunk</i> (Frame 194).",

  "koohiiStory1": "A fine mist is falling, and so everyone gathers around near the tree-trunk, effectively using the rest of the tree as an umbrella in order to keep dry.",
  "koohiiStory2": "By astridtops - In the rainy mist, Totoro is standing in front of a tree-trunk at the bus stop, under the umbrella he just received. Look at him smiling: even when the big drops fall, he remains dry! Great story...which I get to by thinking: tree-trunk->TT ->Tonari no Totoro. I also imagine Mickey Mouse is there too as the KUNyomi for this kanji is みき.",
