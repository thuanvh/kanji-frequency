  "heisigStory": "First, do not confuse this character with <i>venerable old man</i> (Frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an <b>old man</b> begins with an abbreviation of the character for <i>somebody</i>, the <i>nose</i> having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the <i>soil</i> drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when \"dust to dust\" begins to take on a personal meaning; the diagonal <i>walking stick</i> for getting around; and the <i>spoon</i> for being spoon-fed.",
