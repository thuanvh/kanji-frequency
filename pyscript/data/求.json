Whenever we find the <i>needle</i> with that <i>drop</i> in an element that has no other special meaning, we will take advantage of this primitive meaning. At the bottom, we see the <i>grains of rice</i>, the vertical line doubling up for the two elements. Do not confuse with <i>petition</i> (Frame 143).",
