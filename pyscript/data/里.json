  "heisigComment": "* To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a <i>computer</i>, a meaning deriving from the kanji for <i>logic</i>, which we will meet in Lesson 12.",
  "heisigStory": "That's right - a <b><i>ri</i></b>. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One <b><i>ri</i></b> is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the <i>rice field</i>, and below the element for <i>land</i>. Those four sections you see in the <i>rice field</i> (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of <i>land</i>, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a \"country mile.\" The <i>land</i> division based on the size of a <i>rice field</i> is called a <b><i>ri</i></b>.",
