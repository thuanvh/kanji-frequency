  "koohiiStory2": "The high jumper has his wooden leg fitted with a pogo stick, and can now jump even higher. (See my note at traffic (#1408) for pogo stick). EDIT (2 years later): Keyword \"jump\" leads to confusion later on (see cjon256´s post), \"Dancing\" would be better (but be sure to keep it distinct from dance (#1774)). New Story: I was no good at dancing due to my wooden leg... until I had it fitted with a pogo stick!",
