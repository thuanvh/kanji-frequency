  "heisigStory": "To be told that the place of the <i>woman</i> is in the <i>house</i> may not sit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits the Chinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age. So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of <b>relaxing</b> after a hard day's work: the scruffy and weary <i>woman</i> of the <i>house</i> slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap.",

  "koohiiStory1": "It´s funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive... well... if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman relaxing. Cheapest place to do that is in one´s own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? 家で休暇を取るは安いですね。.",
