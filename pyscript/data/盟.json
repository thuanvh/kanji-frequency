  "koohiiStory2": "A new alliance is proclaimed at the end of a meal between officials. As a symbol of their alliance they clean up together one dish, and present it to the photographers. The clean dish under the flash lights appears very bright, and it´s pretty much all you can see on the photo that appears on the next morning´s newspapers, with the title \"New alliance, one bright dish!\".",
