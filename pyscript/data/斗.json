  "heisigComment": "* Since we already have a primitive element for a \"dipper\" - namely, the <i>ladle</i> - we shall let this one stand for a <i>measuring cup</i>. By the way, it would make a rather large one, since the kanji is also used for a measure of about 18 liters!",
  "heisigStory": "The <b>Big Dipper</b> here is of course the constellation of Ursa Major, of which this kanji is a sort of pictographic representation.",

  "koohiiStory1": "Since the meaning of \"big dipper\" is rather specific and the sense of measurement seems to be a more common usage, I concentrate on the primative meaning of measuring cup. This is a pictograph, with the first two strokes representing the measuring ticks on the side of the cup.",
