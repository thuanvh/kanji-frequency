  "koohiiStory1": "The guy who was thrown into the river to sink was given one last request. \"If I´m gonna be sleeping with the fishes,\" he said, \"can I at least have a pillow? I´m real sensitive.\" The mafia bosses laughed. \"Look, my doctor said I can only use wooden pillows, I have a real serious condition. Can I at least die comfortable-like?\" The mafia dudes said fine, and let him have his pillow. They tossed him the river and drove off...and after a minute, he bobbed to the top, thanks to his floating wood pillow.",
