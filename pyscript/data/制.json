  "koohiiStory2": "Why all the gore and violence? How about a samurai cow? He doesn´t have to be a violent samurai, either. He only wears the sword because he´s part of the bushi SYSTEM. Actually, he studies ikebana, shodo, and zen. Imagine him sitting cross-legged in a Zen temple (a very Special Zen temple). The master asks him if a dog has buddha nature and, shifting the swords in his belt, he calmly replies, \"Moo!\".",
