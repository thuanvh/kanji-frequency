  "heisigStory": "Ah, but haven't modern <i>graveyards</i> become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing <b>imitation</b> <i>trees</i> in the <i>graveyard</i>. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long.",
