  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of <i>stream</i> the more vivid image of a <i>flood</i>. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements:<div>on the left, it is written the same.</div><div>on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs</div><div>on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook</div>",
  "heisigStory": "We have taken the image of a river <b>stream</b> over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a <b>stream</b>.",
