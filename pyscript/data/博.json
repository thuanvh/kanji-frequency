  "heisigComment": "* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the <i>needle</i> on the left and gets the meaning of an <i>acupuncturist</i>.",
  "heisigStory": "At the left we have the <i>needle</i>; at the right, the kanji for <i>specialty</i>, plus an extra <i>drop</i> at the top. Think of a <b>Dr.</b> who is a <i>specialist</i> with a <i>needle</i> (an acupuncturist) and let the <i>drop</i> at the top represent the period at the end of <b>Dr.</b> In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.",

The kanji 医 (\"doctor\") is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as \"Dr. Who\", \"Dr. Jekyll\", even \"Dr. Dobb´s\" if you´re into programming.",
