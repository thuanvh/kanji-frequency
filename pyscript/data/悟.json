  "heisigStory": "I know of an Indian religious sect which teaches that <b>enlightenment</b> is to be had by covering the eyes with one's index fingers, the ears with the thumbs, and the mouth with the little fingers. While these differ a bit from the <i>five holes</i> that we used to represent the \"<i>I</i>\" (frame 17), the idea of achieving a special <i>state of mind</i> by covering those five places can help you learn this kanji. You might try the position out while you are learning this character.",
