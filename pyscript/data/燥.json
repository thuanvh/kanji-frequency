  "heisigStory": "<b>Parch</b>ment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial <b>parch</b>ment from <i>wood</i> pulp. The <i>fire</i> at the left and in the \"strong\" position serves to remind us of the root word, \"<b>parch</b>,\" since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like <i>fire</i>. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a \"<i>wood-good</i>,\"), wet it, and hold it over a <i>hearth</i> in your mind's eye. Now watch as it <b>parches</b> the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling <b>parch</b>ment.",

REF: parch (FRAME 215) , maneuver (#671), winding (#1369), seaweed (#2035). Story: It´s been so parched recently that your furniture suddenly catches fire.",
