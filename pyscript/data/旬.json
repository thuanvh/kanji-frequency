  "heisigStory": "There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block often days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classical phrase, <b>decameron</b>, whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of ten <i>days</i> taken by a band of people - that is, a group of people <i>bound together</i> for the <i>days</i> of the <b>decameron</b>.",
