  "koohiiStory1": "Walking legs over \"bushes\" needs to have a primitive meaning of its own. It appears in several kanji, such as 縫 sew (#1563), 逢 tryst (#2417), 蜂 bee (#2687), and 鋒 sword´s point (#2768), and it is clumsy to work bushes and walking legs into every story. \"Pointy\" works fairly well: the walking legs are stuck on top of the pointy part of the bush; and for this character: a summit is the pointy end of a mountain.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Upon reaching the summit of the mountain, I noticed my walking legs were all gouged up from walking through prickly bushes.",
