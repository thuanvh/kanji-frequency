  "koohiiStory2": "Every self-respecting ninja knows the story of \"The Awl and the Sabre\". According to the legend, a woman once defended herself by using an awl against a sabre! She used to work all day with that awl. However, the bandit using the sabre had no skill. And thus the awl beat the sabre. And from there the saying goes : \"The sabre is powerless against the awl, if one can´t use the sabre.\".",
