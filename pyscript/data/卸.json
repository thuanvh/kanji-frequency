  "koohiiStory1": "Wholesale refers to the sale of goods in quantity to retailers for resale. When this kanji was invented, large loads of goods needed to be transported by horses who left steep footprints because of the weight they carried. The wholesale goods needed a special stamp to indicate that they were legal for resale.",
  "koohiiStory2": "If you need horseshoes (shoes that fit your horse´s footprint), buy them at the wholesale shop. They lick and paste stamps in your membership card so you can get free merchandise later.",
