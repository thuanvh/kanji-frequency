  "koohiiStory1": "If you want to get closer to the actual meaning, then I think that 腰(こし) is more like the hips or the small of the back. After being sat down in the office too long, people often say 腰がいたい！It´s the part of the body that needs massaging.",
  "koohiiStory2": "To the puritans reading this site - please stop reporting stories that have anything to do with sex! Although (as wrightak said) this kanji really refers to the hips, Heisig clearly chose the keyword ´loins´ because it was anatomically close enough, and the primitives lent themselves to an easy-to-remember story. Just because you´re all sexually repressed doesn´t mean other people won´t benefit from a story such as \"the part of the body people need more than any other are the loins\".",
