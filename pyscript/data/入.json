  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: <i>to go in</i>, <i>to put in</i>, <i>to come in</i>, and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for <i>umbrella</i>, the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for <i>eight</i>. When it appears in any other position, however, it retains its original form.",
  "heisigStory": "This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftwards, putting one leg forward in order to <b>enter</b> someplace. Since the \"in\" side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character.",
