  "koohiiStory1": "If Mr T was white I am sure he would have been commander in chief of the USA, he just the sort of clown Americans love to vote for. (NB: I tried with the indian chief motif but kept adding feathers by mistake).",
  "koohiiStory2": "Mr T was originally supposed to be the chief of the A-Team, but then the producers realized that America didn´t want to see a Black guy as the chief of a prime-time TV show. So here, we see Mr T doing a bunch of cocaine, and then spreading it all over his face to look white, and trying out for the part of Hannibal. The directors were so impressed that they let him stunt double for Hannibal in a few episodes. OR, Mr T chiefin´ on some crack cocaine. You make the call.",
