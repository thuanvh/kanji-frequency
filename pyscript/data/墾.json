  "koohiiStory1": "It was the groundbreaking of the new farm, but there was an uninvited guest to the ceremony. It was a famous skunk, the one with the familiar silver stripe. The feet of the crowd rushing from the ceremony site churned up the soil very nicely. The ceremony was ruined but the groundbreaking was a great success.",
  "koohiiStory2": "I got sprayed by a skunk, so no one is helping me with the groundbreaking of my farm. On a positive note, I found silver laying all over the soil. Mine all mine!",
