  "heisigStory": "Again I cannot resist sharing my own associations. If you've ever seen Disney's animated interpretation of classical music, \"Fantasia,\" you will recall what was done there with Beethoven's \"Pastoral Symphony\" (the 6th), and the <i>flying horses</i> that figured in it. The mares are bathing in the stream and the stallions begin to gather. As dusk sets in, the <i>flying horses</i> all start <i>yawning</i> and pair off for the night: a perfectly <b>delightful</b> portrait of <b>delight</b>.",
