  "heisigStory": "As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep. It does this by picturing a <i>house</i> with a <i>candle</i> in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is \"burning the <i>candle</i> at both ends,\" and working night after night into the <b>wee hours</b>.",

  "koohiiStory2": "I agree with elktapestry. This kanji really means \"early evening\", not \"wee hours\" [Heisig really should have done his homework on this and several other characters (e.g., #145 \"but of course\" -- what the hell???). Oh well.] \"Every house lights candles in the EARLY EVENING which stay lit until the wee hours\". E.G. 宵の口（よいのくち）early evening; 今宵（こよい）this evening; tonight.",
