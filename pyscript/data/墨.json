  "heisigStory": "Besides meaning <b>black ink</b>, this kanji also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as one might used a chalked string. Here it is used to mark off the <i>dirt</i> with <i>black</i> lines for a foot ballgame (played, I presume, on a white field).",
