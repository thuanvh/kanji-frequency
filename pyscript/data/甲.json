  "heisigStory": "This kanji reverses the element for <i>sprout</i>, giving the image of roots being sent down into the earth by a seed planted in the <i>rice field</i>. From there you must invent a connection to the keyword, <b>armor</b>.",

  "koohiiStory1": "Funny.. this appeared to me as a pictograph of a samurai´s armor. Then I looked up images of the samurai armor and it is not even remotely similar. Then I realised it looks in fact like the belly of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I somehow associated with the samurai armor because of the \"turtle samurai\" that appeared earlier. Fits me. The bit that pokes down is to protect the genitals, I guess.",
