  "heisigStory": "As the days grow shorter and shorter, or so the northern European myth goes, the fear grows that the sun will take its leave of us altogether, abandoning the world to total darkness. Fixing <i>candles</i> to the branches of evergreen <i>trees</i>, it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs. The story is a lot longer and more complex than that, but it should help to fix the image of climbing high up into the <b>treetops</b> to fix <i>candles</i> on the <i>tree</i>.",
