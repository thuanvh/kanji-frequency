  "koohiiStory1": "Well, you usually use your fingers to throw objects used as missile weapons. Easy. By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the missile primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it´s a crotch (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the wind. And for this present kanji, it is something you naturally use with your fingers...",
  "koohiiStory2": "If you use the primitive \"semen\" (flying in the wind from your crotch) instead of missile then all kanjis with this primitive will hilariously create a perfect story.",
