  "koohiiStory1": "A pictograph of a japanese schoolgirl getting groped by perverts on the train. The fingers of course, a crown (her too short skirt) and her legs below (which to be honest are pretty thick like tree trunks).",
  "koohiiStory2": "Note: The combination \"crown +human legs\" appears seven times in Heisig. In four cases (nos. 323, 1327, 1328, 2920) the crown is above the human legs, and in the other three cases (1888, 2472, 2679) one leg passes through the crown. The naming is inconsistent, so I call the first pattern \"Miss World\" (who is wearing a crown she won due to her attractive human legs) and the second \"garter\" (one human leg passes through the crown and wears it as a garter).",
