  "koohiiStory1": "The top 16 strokes are the chinese radical for \"dragon\". Joining up both meanings of the radical we can name the top part of this kanji \"imperial dragon\". Two-headed snakes do exist as biological curiosities, and they look a bit like a slingshot (with the heads splitting at a junction). Our imperial dragon here, the pet of a Chinese emperor, is a rare \"three-headed slingshot-snake\" kept in a vase and fed with meat. When the emperor attacked neighbours, his army wore the imperial dragon garment.",
