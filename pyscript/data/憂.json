  "heisigStory": "<i>Head</i> . . . <i>crown</i> . . . <i>heart</i> . . . <i>walking legs</i>. Two things merit mention here. First, the doubling-up of the last stroke of <i>head</i> with the top of the <i>crown</i> serves to make the whole more aesthetically beautiful. It happens so rarely that the exceptions are easily learned. Second, try to make a single image out of the four elements. (Religious statuary of <b>melancholy</b> figures should offer plenty of suggestions.)",

  "koohiiStory1": "Melancholy makes me think of Hamlet cause he was so ´emo´. In order to play up his feelings he bares his head and holds his crown over his heart then walks (on walking legs) around the palace making everyone see how melancholy he is. What a wuss.",
  "koohiiStory2": "This is an image of the crucifixion. Jesus is on the cross. His crown of thorns has slipped down and is around his neck, right between his head and his heart. His walking legs can be seen dangling from the cross as well. How MELANCHOLY!",
