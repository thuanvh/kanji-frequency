  "koohiiStory1": "The lawyer called all the heirs into a meeting. Everybody else received cars, property, and the like. When it got to be my turn the lawyer informed me I would be receiving a scrapbook. My mouth dropped open. A scrapbook?! No Ferrari, no mansion, ...scrapbook?! Turns out the scrapbook was of my great uncle's company, and I had been named the new director of the multi-million dollar business. My mouth literally hit the scrapbook when I learned I'd be director.",
  "koohiiStory2": "My mouth hung open when I found out I was the heir to not only my father's scrapbooks, but he also left me as director of the company.",
