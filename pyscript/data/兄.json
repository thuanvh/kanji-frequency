  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive this character will take the meaning of <i>teenager</i>, in accord with the familiar image of the big <i>mouth</i> and the gangling, clumsy <i>legs</i>.",
  "heisigStory": "By now kanji like this one should \"look like\" something to you even though it is more of an \"ideogram\" than a \"pictograph.\" The large <i>mouth</i> on top and the <i>human legs</i> below almost jump off the page as a caricature of <b>elder brother</b>, the one with the big <i>mouth</i> (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who \"has the say\" among all the children).",
