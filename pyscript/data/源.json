  "heisigStory": "With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see <i>water</i> and <i>meadow</i> in this character for <b>source</b>. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word \"surge\") and in popular usage, <b>source</b> suggests the place <i>water</i> comes from. In this kanji, it is under the <i>meadow</i>, where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little <i>springs</i>.",
