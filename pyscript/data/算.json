  "koohiiStory1": "Before the time of digital calculators, people used old school calculators made of bamboo (abacus). It´s not as easy as a calculator, but you don´t need any batteries either. All you need are your eyes and your two hands.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Tip : you may see this as an Abacus, which is used to calculate. This particular ancient chinese Abacus has eyeballs in place of beads, and its frame is made of bamboo.
