  "heisigStory": "The key word for this kanji connotes the \"muddying\" effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a \"j\" is <b>voiced</b> while a \"sh\" is unvoiced. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is <b>voiced</b>. The primitives are: <i>water</i> . . . <i>eye</i> . . . <i>bound up</i> . . . <i>insect</i>.",
