  "koohiiStory1": "I promise to use my ear to do nothing but listen ... stick a needle in my eye, cross my heart and hope to die! (Intentionally said backwards to get the order of the primitives correct).",
  "koohiiStory2": "Listening to others is different from hearing [1626] with the ear. One must allow the words to pierce through the eyes (the window of the soul) and reach deep into the heart...a symbol of thinking about and contemplating on what was said, not just the sounds of words spoken. A married man while reading his newspaper, his wife going on about something suddenly, says, \"You´re not listening to me, are you?\" He replies, \"I heard every word you said. You said...\" “Yes, but you´re not listening.\".",
