  "heisigStory": "Something referred to as \"over <b>yonder</b>\" is usually far off in the distance and barely within sight - like a wee <i>drop</i> in the distance - and is usually an expression used in giving directions or pointing something out. Hence this kanji begins with a <i>drop</i>. Then we find a sort of transparent <i>helmet</i> with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent <i>mouth</i> under it, obviously an extraterrestrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its <i>mouth</i> open like that? Why, about his spaceship way over <b>yonder</b> with its fuel tank on empty.",
