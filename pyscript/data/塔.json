The two sides combine to create a great <b>pagoda</b> made of <i>dirt</i>, with <i>flowers</i> by the tens of thousands <i>fitted</i> together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and <i>fit</i> a few of the <i>flowers</i> in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force.",
