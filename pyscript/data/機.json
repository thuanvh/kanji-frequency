  "koohiiStory1": "An abacus is a mechanism made of wood used to calculate how many ´anythings´.",
  "koohiiStory2": "To avoid confusing with contraption (#677), focus on the \"ism\" of mechanism. For example, fetishism refers to having a fetish; mechanism here refers to having a mecha-like property, where mecha is a type of anime robot that can transform itself. Imagine a mecha that can transform itself between two forms: a huge immovable tree (as a form of defense) and a gigantic marching abacus that smashes enemies between its giant beads.",
