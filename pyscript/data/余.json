  "heisigComment": "* Since the phrase \"<i>too much</i>\" is overly abstract, we shall take the image of a <i>scale</i> whose indicator spins round and round on the dial because <i>too much</i> weight has been set on it. It will help to use this image in learning the kanji itself.",
  "heisigStory": "<i>Umbrella</i> . . . <i>potato</i> . . . <i>little</i>. The last stroke of <i>potato</i> and the first of <i>little</i> coincide in this character.",

  "koohiiStory2": "This is the kanji for 「あまり Amari」, which means too little in negative sentences and too much in the rest (always with a negative sense). I take the liberty of using the symbol \">\" (more than, another meaning!!) as the umbrella component, and using two (#2) and little (#105) for the potato primitive. So, this kanji either means \"two much\" (more than 2) or \"two little\". (thanks, Virtua_leaf and Thunderball!).",
