  "koohiiStory1": "Traditional Japanese storefront doors have several flags, known as \"noren,\" hanging down from a curtain rod in front of them. I see this as a pseudo-pictograph, and use the horizontal line across the top to represent the curtain rod, since noren don´t usually hang from the ceiling.",
