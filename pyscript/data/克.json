  "heisigStory": "In this frame we get a chance to use the kanji we just learned in its primitive meaning of <i>teenager</i>. The <i>needle</i> on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the <i>teenager</i> growing up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the <i>needle</i> at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that \"We Shall <b>Overcome</b>\" the plague, will the <i>needle</i> cease to hangover their heads, as it does in this character.",
