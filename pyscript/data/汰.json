  "heisigStory": "This character can mean both to <b>cleanse</b> and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly <i>plump</i> going to a skinny spa whose medicinal <i>waters</i> promise to <b>cleanse</b> him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the <i>water</i>.",

  "koohiiStory1": "I couldn´t find any reference to this kanji as meaning cleanse. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰（さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to ´select´ so maybe Heisig meant cleanse in the ethnic sense here.. I´m going to use the keyword \"selection\", as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out.",
