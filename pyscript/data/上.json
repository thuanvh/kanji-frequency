  "heisigStory": "The two directions, <b>above</b> and below, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a <i>magic wand</i> standing <b><i>above</i></b> a <i>floor</i>&nbsp;- \"magically,\" you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words <b>above</b> and <i>below</i> suggest each other.",
