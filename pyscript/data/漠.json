  "heisigStory": "Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are <b>vaguely</b> discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true <i>graveyard</i>. The <i>water</i> may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock - anything that helps you associate <b>vagueness</b> with the <i>graveyard</i> and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame.",
