  "heisigComment": "* While this kanji has obvious affinities to the \"seed\" group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the <i>monkey</i> (the one who <i>speaketh</i> no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take <i>monkey</i> as its primitive meaning.",
  "heisigStory": "The olde English is used here to indicate a humble form of the third person singular of the verb \"to speak.\" It is written by a <i>tongue wagging in the mouth</i> with a <i>walking stick</i> rammed through it and coming out at both ends.",
