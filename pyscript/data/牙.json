  "heisigComment": "* Since this kanji has 4 strokes, you would expect that as a primitive it would also have 4 - but in fact it has 5 in the following two frames (the second stroke between divided into 2 strokes) and reverts to 4 again in frame 2056.",
  "heisigStory": "If you play with this primitive's form with pencil and paper, you will see that it begins with a <i>box</i>-like shape, and ends with the final two strokes of the <i>halberd</i>, a convenient combination for the <b>tusk</b> protruding from the mouth of an animal.",
