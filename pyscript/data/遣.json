  "heisigStory": "This kanji takes away the <i>maestro</i>'s baton and replaces it with a <i>purse</i>. The <i>road</i> represents his being <b>dispatched</b> on his way a san obvious misfit. You will remember that when he did have his baton, he was being <i>chased</i> down the road by his fans. All of which shows what a difference a single stroke can make!",
