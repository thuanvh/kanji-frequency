  "koohiiStory2": "Words signify the written words in a book. The fruit represents something whole, complete. A chapter in a book often offers a complete idea, setting, or account. It´s good to disambiguate the keyword from paragraph (#82). To reinforce the kanji, imagine eating a fruit at the end of each chapter of Tolstoy´s \"War and Peace\" to reward yourself. (If you ate a fruit at the end of each paragraph, you´d very quickly run out of fruit).",
