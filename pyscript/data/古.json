  "heisigComment": "* Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of <i>old</i>, but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible.",
  "heisigStory": "The primitive elements that compose this character are <i>ten</i> and <i>mouth</i>, but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with <b>old</b> inscriptions on the tombstones. This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character \"drawings.\"",
