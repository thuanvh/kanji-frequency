It´s still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor´s crotch is a great way to express friendship.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Think of a sex friend (a fuck buddy if you will). The benefit of such a relationship is that there will always be a crotch by your side. (the Japanese refer to such a friend as セフレ, just as we do).",
