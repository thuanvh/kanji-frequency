He says he has a fascination for ghosts ever since he saw one as a teenager. Since then he´s been scouring all of the world, trying to capture them on tape, on video... A journalist asks \"When will it end ? Aren´t you tired of chasing ghosts ?\" \"Oh no, not yet ! Not until I become a ghost myself anyway !\".",
