  "koohiiStory1": "Can´t see direct relation to Big Dipper (#1177) since its writing order is completely different. As raulir noted, it´s written as overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and the first of メ. I take it as a pictograph or treasure map. Two dots represent big trees and the cross (marking the treasure) is placed relative to them.",
