  "koohiiStory2": "Deer are well known for frolicking in groves of trees. However, they are not well known for actually watching where the heck they are bounding about. Here we have a bunch of dead deer bodies that you find at the foot of a mountain. You are trying to figure why there are so many dead deer in one spot, and then you trace a line up the mountain - leaves and such are scattered all the way up...to a grove. Looks like they hopped through some leaves to their doom.",
