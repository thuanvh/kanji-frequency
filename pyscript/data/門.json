  "heisigStory": "The pictograph of two swinging <b>gates</b> is so clear in this kanji that only its stroke order needs to be memorized. In case you should have any trouble, though, you might doodle with the shapes on a piece of paper, taking care to note the difference in the stroke order of the two facing doors. The <b>gates</b> usually serve as an enclosure, and are written BEFORE whatever it is they enclose.",

  "koohiiStory1": "Heisig´s stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful -- first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the \"sun\" attachment as you would normally. In fact, if you just wrote it out as two suns with elongated sides, you´ll get the stroke order exactly correct.",
