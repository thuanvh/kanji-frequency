Now can you see the two <i>elbows</i> (with the second stroke doubling up) at the top, and the character for <i>little</i> below?",

However, in the cases where this primitive appears under other primitives, as opposed to on the left (I think there are ~5 times in this chapter) I´ve opted to use a similar character: Venom. This helps keep the positioning clear, especially on such characters as dainty (#1363) and accumulate (#1364).",
