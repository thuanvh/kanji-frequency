  "heisigStory": "When it is time to <b>breed</b> new cattle, the bull is usually willing but the <i>cow</i> is often not. Thus the <i>taskmaster</i> to the right forces the <i>cow</i> into a compromising position, so to speak, so that she and her mate can <b>breed</b>.",

  "koohiiStory1": "Imagine a taskmaster giving a cow the command to \"start breeding, and start doing it now!\", except that the cow takes his advice a bit too literally and starts chasing the taskmaster to carry out this command! instead of finding another cow to breed with. Hence, you see the taskmaster running to the right, trying to stay ahead of the cow.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Hint: This is the kanji from which taskmaster is derived. Actually, this kanji has nothing to do with breed, and a lot to do with pastures and shepherds (also for cowboys, japanese and spanish don´t differenciate between animals). Think of a cowboy (taskmaster) who brings his cows to the pasture.",
