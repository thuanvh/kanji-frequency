  "heisigStory": "What makes a <i>tree</i> begin to <b>wither</b> up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple <i>old age</i>, as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled <i>old tree</i>, <b>withering</b> away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over.",
