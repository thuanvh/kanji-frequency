  "heisigStory": "From its original meaning of a defined area or zone, a <b>range</b> has also come to mean a grazing <i>land</i> where cowboys roam and do whatever it is they do with cows. When the herds have all been driven to market, there is a great homecoming <i>fiesta</i> like that pictured here. As soon as the cowboys come home, home on the <b>range</b>, the first thing they do is kiss the ground (the <i>mouth</i> on the <i>floor</i>), and then get on with the <i>fiesta</i>.",

  "koohiiStory1": "An astronaut lands back at the launch range, kisses the earth beneath him with his mouth, then heads off to a fiesta to celebrate a safe flight.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Instead of Heisig´s \"Fiesta\" I use \"Spear\". Why? A spear is just a DROP extra on an Arrow. 域, range actually means range as in limits/boundary/border sort of range(In a box it was the old meaning for Country國 (581). Ok way too much etymology here, but back to story. With your SPEAR standing in a HOLE on the FLOOR with SOIL to its left9as you dug some out), you can see the RANGE of the spear in attacking a possible enemy (re Diablo and other RPGs, spear´s have range).",
