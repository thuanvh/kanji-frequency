  "heisigStory": "Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for <b>illuminate</b> can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something <i>shine</i>. If you glaze a pot and put it into the <i>oven</i> to <i>fire</i> it, you in fact <i>illuminate</i> it. Hence the kanji for <b>illuminate</b> compares the kanji for <i>shining</i> with the primitive element for the <i>oven's fire</i>.",
