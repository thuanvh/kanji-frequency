  "heisigStory": "Reading this kanji from the top down, we have: <i>horns</i> . . . <i>nose</i>. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head hanging on the den wall, with its great <i>horns</i> and long <i>nose</i>. Now while we would speak of cutting off a moose's \"head\" to hang on the wall, the Japanese speak of cutting off its <b>neck</b>. It's all a matter of how you look at it. Anyway, if you let the word <b>neck</b> conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g <b>neck</b> hanging over the fireplace, whose <i>horns</i> you use for a coat-rack and whose <i>nose</i> has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character. Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first introduced the element for <i>horns</i>: that they can never be left floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent that from happening, as is the case here.",
