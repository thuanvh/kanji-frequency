  "heisigStory": "This character, a pictograph of a <b>spoon</b>, is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for <i>seven</i>, where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Not only is stroke order important, but also be sure to note the direction of a stroke. In both ´spoon´ and ´seven´, the first stroke is the horizontal one - but here it is written right to left in a downward flick, while in ´seven´ it is a strong line from left to right.",
