  "heisigStory": "The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of <i>metal</i> to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked. It was discovered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subconscious reactions when the <i>truth</i> was getting too close for comfort. Nowadays, people can take drugs that <b>tranquillize</b> them in such a way as to neutralize the effect of the device, which is why other means have had to be developed.",
