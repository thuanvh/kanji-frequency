  "heisigStory": "This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrase sand sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase <b>but of course</b>. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a <i>teenager</i>, and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. \"Did you have a good shower?\" \"<b>But of course</b>,\" you reply, annoyed. So <i>water</i> and <i>teenager</i> combine to give us <b>but of course</b>.",

Heisig must have a drinking CONDITION. But of course, if Heisig sticks to water, rather than sake (like me, water quaffing, situation assessing, sober elder brother), his SITUATION may improve.´\"　[MODEL COMPOUND: 状況　(じょうきょう)　state of affairs; conditions].",
