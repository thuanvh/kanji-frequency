  "koohiiStory1": "There was a man in a village who had a special gift : whenever he shouted and screamed, his mouth became a cornucopia, overflowing with fruits and food of all sorts. Many of the locals thought he was a cruel man, always screaming at his wife, until they realised he was in fact very kind, and his gift brought prosperity to his family.",
  "koohiiStory2": "You can hold a CORNUCOPIA up to your MOUTH (like a megaphone) to SHOUT lounder. Also notice that the shape of CORNUCOPIA implies the shouts are 4 letter words.",
