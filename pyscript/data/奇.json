  "heisigStory": "The elements we are given to work with here are <i>St. Bernard dog</i> and <i>can</i>. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word <i>can</i>. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along)&nbsp;to stick closely to the&nbsp;elements, in this case, <i>mouth</i>&nbsp;and <i>nails</i>. Now all we need do is create a fictitious \"<b>Strange</b> But True\" column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a <i>St. Bernard</i> whose <i>mouth</i> has been <i>nailed</i> shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard.",
