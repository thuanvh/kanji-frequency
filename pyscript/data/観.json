  "koohiiStory2": "I used to hate birds.They´re loud, stupid and worst of all they shit on your head. Used to think birds were the most vile creatures on earth. Then I encountered a pegasus. I was just walking down the road, minding my own business when I happened to look up. I saw it there, braying noisily, ivory wings outstretched like an angel, back leg raised ever so slightly. It dropped a steaming brown load right on my face. It changed my outlook completely. Birds are the second most vile creatures on earth.",
