  "koohiiStory1": "Mister T substitutes an arrow for a toothpick -- The keyword meaning is to replace something with something else, to act for another, to represent. It´s best to stick to the first meaning, because the last two are very close to \"mediator\" which will come in frame 1761. The idea here is that the arrow is not a toothpick, neither it is changed into one, but it can substitute for one.",
