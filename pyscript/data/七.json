  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of <i>diced</i>, i.e., \"cut\" into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for <i>cut</i> to be learned in a later lesson (Frame 89).",
  "heisigStory": "Note that the first stroke \"cuts\" through the second. This distinguishes <b>seven</b> from the character for <i>spoon</i>&nbsp;(Frame 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short.",
