  "heisigStory": "We begin with the two elements on the right, <i>baseball</i> and <i>needle</i>. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a <i>game of cricket</i> in which a <i>needle</i> is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a <i>rock</i> for a ball. A <b>smash</b> hit would probably splinter the bat in all directions, and a <b>smashing</b> pitch would do the same with the <i>needle</i> wicket.",
