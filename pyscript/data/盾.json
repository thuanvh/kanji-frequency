  "koohiiStory2": "From Wikipedia: \"If a Spartan hoplite were to return to Sparta alive and without his shield, it was assumed that he threw his shield at the enemy in an effort to flee; an act punishable by death or banishment.\" Picture the enemy of a Spartan soldier poking his eyes out with a sewing needle and trying to steal his shield. However, the Spartan desperately clutches on, and is dragged around for a while, preferring to die than to lose his shield.",
