  "koohiiStory1": "It´s the latest Japanese game show: Forudo! Contestants are given a sheet of paper and are told to fold it into a complex origami shape. If they´re not done in 60 seconds, a huge axe descends from the ceiling and chops their work in half. Contestants know to recoil their hands from the falling axe, but some have been so absorbed in folding, they ignore the buzzer and get their fingers chopped off.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Fold some origami into the shape of an axe with your fingers. It´s even as sharp, so watch out for paper cuts!",
