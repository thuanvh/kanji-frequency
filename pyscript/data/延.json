  "heisigStory": "This character is a kind of pictographic image of how <b>prolonging</b> is a clever way of <i>stopping</i> things by trying to <i>stretch</i> them out a little bit at a time (the extra <i>drop</i> at the top of <i>stop</i>). Be sure to get a concrete image of this process, by imagining yourself <b>prolonging</b> something you can really, physically, <i>stretch</i>.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Here´s a great mnemonic: \"stop, drop, and stretch (!?).\" Now let´s associate it with ´prolong´: if you´re ever in an uncomfortable spot, like being asked tricky questions or caught in a lie, just PROLONG the situation - stop, drop, and stretch. They may be confused by your odd behaviour, but it´ll buy you a few moments to think up another good lie to get out of the sticky situation!",
