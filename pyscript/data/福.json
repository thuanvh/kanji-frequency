  "koohiiStory1": "This recalls the selling of indulgences in the history of the Church (As an aside, Protestantism began as a protest of this practice). Basically, one gave wealth to the altar (i.e. priest) and received a blessing. If you prefer a Jewish version, think of the donation (wealth) that is expected when you´re called to the ark (altar in the kanji) to give a blessing over the torah.",
