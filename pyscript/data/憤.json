  "koohiiStory1": "Note: this word in Japanese has the idea of \"indignant\". So aroused here refers to being aroused because of anger over some unjust or wrong act, unfairness etc. It doesn´t seem to carry a meaning associated with arousal in the sense of sex or pleasure. So, my story: think of the angry state of mind aroused at finding all your clams buried under your haystack stolen, gone!",
  "koohiiStory2": "Data was aroused/indignant when he saw what the volcano had done to the farmers building their haystacks and the fishermen collecting their shells . The tragedy of it all aroused him so much he didn´t even notice he was feeling emotion.",
