  "heisigStory": "You will need to refer back to frames 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: <i>flesh</i> (<i>part of the body</i>) and <i>brain</i>. What the kanji says, if you look at it, is that the <i>part of the body</i> that keeps the <i>brain</i> in working order is the <b>stomach</b>. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this kanji think of the <i>brain</i> as being \"held up\" by the <i>flesh</i>.",
