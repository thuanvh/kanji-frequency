  "heisigComment": "* The primitive meaning, <i>genie</i>, derives from the roots of the word <i>genius</i>. Use the <i>genie</i> out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered, and the meaning becomes a <i>genie in the bottle</i>.",
  "heisigStory": "Whatever one is particularly adept at - one's special \"<b>genius</b>\" - one can do very easily, \"with one finger\" as the phrase goes. This kanji is a pictograph of that one finger. Note how its distinctive form is created by writing the final stroke of the element for <i>fingers</i> backwards.",
