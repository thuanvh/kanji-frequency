  "koohiiStory2": "Simple-minded blond girl (see frame 1928) is very good at Zen, which isn´t surprising since she doesn´t think much. She has this bad habit of meditating perched on the main temple altar, which infuriates the Zen buddhists. When they get up to her and tell her rudely to step down the altar, she just smiles and teases them : \"Not very zen are you ?\". Who would have thought simple-minded blond girl would teach the Zen buddhists a lesson !",
