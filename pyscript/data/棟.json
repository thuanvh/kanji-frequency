  "koohiiStory2": "Ok just a note to the ´ridgepole facing east story´ im making up a story to JUSTIFY why that is the case. Assuming that 99% of you guys use the age old story of a ´sun rising through a tree tells you were the east is´, back in those days when people used ridgepoles they wanted to align their houses in such a way that they face the rising sun, so they wake up with a bright day, and wake up early with the sun seeping through in a perpendicular manner( as the ridge pole faces the sun in the morning).",
