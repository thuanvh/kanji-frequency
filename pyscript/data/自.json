  "heisigComment": "* The same meaning of <i>oneself</i> can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of <i>nose</i> or <i>nostrils</i>, both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for <i>nose</i> (Frame 733).",
  "heisigStory": "You can think of this kanji as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little <i>drop</i> that Mother Nature set between your <i>eyes</i>. The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose - giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for <b>oneself</b>.",
