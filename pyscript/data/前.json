  "heisigStory": "We waited to introduce this character until now, even though the pieces have been available for some time, because it helps to reinforce the odd kanji of the last frame. Picture the <i>butcher</i> hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram's <i>horns</i> placed <b>in front</b> of him (or on his head, if you prefer). There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for <i>before</i> (Frame 263), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book.",
