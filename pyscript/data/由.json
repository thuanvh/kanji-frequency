  "heisigStory": "The \"<b>wherefore</b>\" of this kanji explains the reason or origin of a thing. It does this graphically by depicting a seed in a <i>rice field</i> sending up a single sprout, which is the whole why and <b>wherefore</b> of the seed's falling in the earth and dying. (When the <i>flower</i> appears, you will recall from frame 249, we have a full <i>seedling</i>.)",

For one, it´s often mistranslated as \"where\" when in fact it´s an urge to know a cause or reason; and two, because this kanji represents the reason, not the urge. [A thought sprouts from my brain. I think, therefore I am.].",
