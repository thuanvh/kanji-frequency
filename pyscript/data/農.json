  "koohiiStory1": "Imagine if you could bend a dragon to your will. Helpful in war, yes, but also a boon for agriculture. The dragon could use its sharp claws to plough the ground, and use its firey breath to clear the land. But first you'd have to bend the dragon to your will -- not an easy task.",
  "koohiiStory2": "It's a good agricultural sign when, as the farmer is bending down, he discovers some plants arranged in the sign of the dragon. It means the weather and earth will be supportive of the crops.",
