  "koohiiStory1": "The imperial seal is usually an impressive mark made with a jewel. However when the letter arrives it has been raining on it and you see that the drops of rain have been transformed into little x’s where some animal legs have run over it.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Primitives (to give correct stroke order): tool bench, towel, 4 Xs, jewel. Story: the Imperial Seal is like a kind of coat-of-arms the Emperor can stamp on stuff. Picture that coat-of-arms as depicting a big jewel (say, a diamond) with a motto on a banner above it saying 'let it be (#2074)'. (The emperor must have been a huge Beatles fan).",
