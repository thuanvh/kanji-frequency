  "koohiiStory1": "After her boyfriend´s crotch has been satisfied, a woman might suggest they cuddle. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might say, \"Or again, we could fool around . . . \".",
  "koohiiStory2": "This keyword should really be \"again\" not \"or again\" Here is some context: think of the phrase \"Jya mata\" \"じゃ又\" which is a farewell similar to \"then again\". Also \"Mata ne\" \"又ね\" and mata ashita (again tomorrow) \"又明日\"。 Note this kanji is rarely used, most of the time JP people spell it out \"mata\" except for in the last example: 又明日.",
