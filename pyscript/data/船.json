  "koohiiStory2": "Aargh, hard to keep this separate from boat. How about this: the phrase \"shape up or ship out!\" This phrase originally meant that a soldier had better get his act together, or else face being shipped off into a combat zone. Here we see a poor WW-I soldier who has been shipped off to a combat zone. He´s riding in the boat overseas to fight in the trenches (gulley).",
