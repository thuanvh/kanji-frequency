  "heisigStory": "\"In the <b>beginning</b>...\"&nbsp;starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made <i>two</i> of them, man and woman. While we presume she made <i>two</i> of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only&nbsp;<i>two</i> and a pair of <i>human legs</i> come to the kanji that means <b>beginning</b>.",

  "koohiiStory2": "In the beginning God created woman, and God asked her how she liked his work. Woman replied, \"Well, you know how I have two eyes, two arms, two legs... it seems redundant to have three breasts. It would look more symmetrical with two.\" God nodded, and the middle breast fell off... and it was good. Woman picked up the breast and said, \"Thank you, God! But what do I do with this useless boob?\" And God created man. That´s why the women today only have two boobs to match their two human legs.",
