  "heisigComment": "* We will keep this image of a <i>spring</i> when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for <i>water</i>) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for <i>little</i>.",
  "heisigStory": "Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling <b>spring</b> of <i>water</i>, and you will probably notice how the top of the <b>spring</b> you are thinking of, the part where the \"bubbling\" goes on, is all <i>white</i>. Happily, the <i>white</i> is just where it should be, at the top, and the <i>water</i> is at the bottom.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot spring. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot spring: a little white towel on top, water below. (This helps keep all associations: spring, little and onsen).",
