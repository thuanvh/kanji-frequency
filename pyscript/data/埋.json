Only here, we are <b>burying</b> our beloved <i>computer</i> that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the \"Dies irae, dies illa\" and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little <i>dirt</i> into what will be its final resting place.
