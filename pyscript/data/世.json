  "heisigStory": "We generally consider one <b>generation</b> as a period of thirty (or <i>ten</i> plus <i>ten</i> plus <i>ten</i>) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form - not in its stroke order - you will see three <i>tens</i>. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as \"addition\" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: <i>ten</i> \"plus\" <i>ten</i> \"plus\" <i>ten</i> = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book.",
