  "koohiiStory2": "As a verb this means, this means \"to ask; to enquire; to search; to look for; to look into; to investigate;\". Imagine the police inquiring in an in-depth investigation. They are interrogating a suspect. But the suspect has a crafty mouth and is very sly. He/she also knows when to keep their mouth shut(glued) at the right moments to avoid self-incrimination. As a final measure, the police torture the suspect by tickling him/her with a broom while they inquire.",
