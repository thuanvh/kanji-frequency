  "heisigStory": "Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a <i>cow</i> with <i>human legs</i>, as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a <i>cow</i>-suit. I always thought I'd prefer to be the one standing <b>before</b>, rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the \"butt\" of everyone's laughter.",
