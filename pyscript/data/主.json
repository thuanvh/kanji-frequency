  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass <i>candlestick</i> (with the drop representing the flame at the top).",
  "heisigStory": "A man's home is his castle, goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was <b>lord</b> of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or <i>drop</i>) of a <i>king</i> in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to \"read off\" the primitives in this way, you won't end up putting the <i>drop</i> down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Although this kanji´s meaning hasn´t caused me much trouble, I´ve had problems remembering the direction of the drop above king, since drops at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions. To remember this one, I think of the placement of the drop in jewel (#256). Both of them use the king primitive and include a short drop stroke going from the top left to bottom right.",
