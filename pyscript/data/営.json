  "koohiiStory2": "During the German occupation, this Nazi officer´s occupation was to manage schools that were requisitioned for training the children of the Aryan race to stand proud with an erect spine (mnemonic : \"the occupation´s spine schools\"). Kanji meanings : to manage, to conduct (business), and also \"barracks; camp; encapment\". This story should help avoid confusion with post (#824) and employ (#1083). The military occupation theme hints to the secondary meaning, e.g. 営倉 \"detention barracks\".",
