  "koohiiStory1": "Heat up those RICE SEEDLINGS you pulled from the SOIL in a ROUND pan over a low FLAME. (Note: the hot pan image helps reinforce the idea that this kanji for \"atsui\" refers to something hot to the touch, as opposed to hot weather).",
  "koohiiStory2": "Just a comment on Erikkusan's story: Although one of the pronunciations of this kanji is \"atsui\" this isn't the atsui that you feel in Tokyo in August, (which is Frame 1260's \"sultry' 暑). This atsui is the one when you touch something hot, like a fry pan. Another reading of this is \"netsu,\" which is the \"fever\" this fat man may feel after planting the rice seedlings.",
