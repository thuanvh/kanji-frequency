On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame.",
  "heisigStory": "Note the <i>drop</i> here in the king's <i>scepter</i>, which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious <b>jewel</b> handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power.",
