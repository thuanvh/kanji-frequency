  "koohiiStory2": "This kanji also means \"linked\" or \"series\" so I´ve changed the kanji meaning to \"GO ALONG (WITH EACH OTHER).\" Well, a ROAD and a CAR certainly GO ALONG with each other. And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD. This Kanji is the \"Union\" in Soviet Union and the \"United\" of United Nations (the countries that \"go along with each other\" at least some of the time).",
