  "heisigStory": "This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical \"man in the moon.\" (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one <b>month</b>, of course, is one cycle of the moon.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air \"mooning\" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of month, considering that months were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning \"ass\" part of it connects well to Hesig´s seemingly unconnected \"flesh\" or \"part of the body\" meaning (when used in primitive form).",
