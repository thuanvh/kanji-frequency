  "koohiiStory1": "This Japanese couple wrote the vows that they had made to each other onto a piece of paper and then folded it into an origami, and put it somewhere in their appartment. To everybody else it is an origami, but to them it is also a symbol of their vows. -- \"the folded words are vows\". Note : in this story and a few others I use the image of an origami for the primitive \"fold\".",
