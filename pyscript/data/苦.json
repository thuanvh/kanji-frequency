  "heisigStory": "The picture of <b>suffering</b> we are given here is that of a <i>flower</i> that has grown <i>old</i>. When a <i>flower</i> ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even <b>suffers</b>. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better.",
