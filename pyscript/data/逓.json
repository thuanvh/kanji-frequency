  "koohiiStory1": "Picture a crude drag-sled - in this case, made from cornstalks that have been belted together - filled with parcels, that the postman drags along behind him down the road along his delivery route.",
  "koohiiStory2": "(I prefer 2 towels over cornstalk and belt) - Have you ever wondered why your parcels always end up in such bad condition when you get them? Or why you never get them at all? That´s because you´ve never looked at how they´re actually delivered - each postman is given a load of parcel post and 2 towels to drag them down the road on.",
