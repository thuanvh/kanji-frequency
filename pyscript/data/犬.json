  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a <i>chihuahua</i> for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of <i>a pack of wild dogs</i>.",
  "heisigStory": "We know that the character for <i>large</i> takes on the meaning of the <i>St. Bernard</i> <b>dog</b> when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The <i>drop</i> added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized <b>dog</b>, which compared to the <i>St. Bernard</i> is no more than a <i>drop</i> in the kennel.",
