  "heisigStory": "The element for <i>day</i> on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see <i>staples</i> being held in <i>mouth</i> (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's <b>spare time</b>. The small <i>box</i> at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly \"inside out.\" Finally, we have the <i>crotch</i> at the bottom.",

You see them stapling their mouths shut, or throwing eachother upside down in boxes or kicking each other in the crotch.",
