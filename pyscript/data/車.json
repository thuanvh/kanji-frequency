  "heisigStory": "You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, <b>car</b>, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Rather than hobbling along with a walking stick to cross through a span, it´s much better to use a car. (Imagine an old man with a walking stick creeping along a span of road, and you, in a car, whizzing right by him. It´s funny ´cause it´s true.) Also, it´s important to include the word \"through,\" so you know the walking stick goes right THROUGH the span.",
