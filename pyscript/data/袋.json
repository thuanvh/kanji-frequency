  "koohiiStory2": "A worker who was recently sacked from his job, is wearing a sack of potatoes as a substitute garment (naked otherwise), in some kind of protest. The kanji is close to frame 1547 \"bag\", and although the later really refers to a \"straw sack\", I use the image of a sack of potatoes here, and that of a \"plastic bag\" for frame 1547. The keywords would have been better swapped in my opinion, but the relevancy is not so important at this point (see notes of Lesson 31 in the book).",
