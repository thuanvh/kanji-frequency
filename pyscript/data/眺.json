  "heisigStory": "To give someone the \"evil <i>eye</i>\" is to <b>stare</b> at them, wishing them evil. The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being <b>stared</b> at is depicted as an <i>eye</i> that <i>portends</i> evil.",

  "koohiiStory1": "Sauron´s One fiery eye stare at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.",
  "koohiiStory2": "You lost a staring contest with a turtle because you blinked your eye before he did. (The contest wasn´t fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don´t need to blink so often.) Eye comes first, because stare is most associated with eyes. And compare with challenge (#658) where this same obstreperous turtle challenges you to a finger wrestling contest. (Sibyl´s story with some notes that helped me).",
