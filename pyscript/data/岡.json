  "koohiiStory2": "This has the same meaning as 丘, so my \"Mount\" is a hill with mountain goats on it under a glass canopy. It´s obviously an effort by the locals to add some Mount atmosphere to their hill. As a primitive, it has the meaning \"sturdy\" (really), which Heisig has not used for some reason, but I will. The glass canopy must be pretty sturdy to keep the goats inside (bulletproof glass, I´m sure).",
