  "koohiiStory1": "The owl looks for its prey in the rice field. It sees so many potential animals to eat but since it only has one mouth, it decides that the tasty looking chihuahua will be its meal for tonight. (adapted from Copycatken,1-9-2006).",
  "koohiiStory2": "I have a strange story for this one but it works. I imagine a owl getting into a rice field which serves as a boxing ring. His opponent is a little chihuahua. The fight starts, the owl takes one punch to the mouth and is out cold. In the chihuahua´s corner is that coach from Rocky saying \"Your an ANIMAL!!\". A vivid image of this story works pretty well for me.",
