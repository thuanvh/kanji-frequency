  "heisigStory": "A <b>lunatic</b> is literally one driven mad by the light of the moon, and the most famous of the \"<b>looneys</b>\" are the legendary lycanthropes or \"wolfmen.\" Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon, sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this kanji, imagine one of these lycanthropes going <b>looney</b> and setting himself up as <i>king</i> of a <i>pack of wild dogs</i> that roams about and terrorizes innocent suburban communities.",
