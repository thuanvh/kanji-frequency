  "koohiiStory2": "After training your whole life, you manage to get a bronze medal in the Olympics. You´re extremely proud of your accomplishment as you step up to receive your medal. The guy in first place is up on a pedestal, towering above you, his elbow level with your mouth. Being a smug bastard, he \"accidentally\" knocks his elbow into your mouth, causing you to bleed and lose a tooth. Just cause he won the gold doesn´t mean he can place himself on such a high pedestal and do whatever he wants!",
