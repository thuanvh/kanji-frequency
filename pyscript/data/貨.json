  "koohiiStory2": "This is a freight train that runs on spare change. Imagine getting on the freight train with a bunch of spare change. You put in some change and it starts up...goes for a few minutes, then starts to slow down. You look at the slot..there´s actually a slot for spare change and one for regular shells. Your call, but it seems to prefer spare change over shells.",
