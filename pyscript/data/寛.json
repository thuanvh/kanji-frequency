  "heisigStory": "The <i>house</i> of <i>flowers</i> or \"hothouse\" has become a metaphor for a narrow-minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. <b>Tolerance</b>, in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage <b>tolerance</b> in those who lack it is first to have them <i>see</i> through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji.",
