  "koohiiStory2": "Building on johnskb: Although it goes against the Heisig method, this story is a lot easier to remember when you know it´s the kanji for \"boku.\" Males usually use either \"boku\" or \"ore\" (instead of \"watashi\") to refer themselves. \"Boku\" is slightly boyish and soft; \"ore\" is rough & tough. Mr. T would definitely use \"ore\" -- but when he´s one of the husbands hung upside down in a row about to be punished by his wife, he puts on a sweet act and switches to \"boku\" when he pleads \"come on baby, it´s ME!\".",
