  "heisigComment": "* We will keep <i>fishhook</i> as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples follow.",
  "heisigStory": "The kanji shown here actually represents the \"second\" position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternate way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among its many other meanings are \"pure,\" \"tasteful,\" \"quaint,\" and - get this! - <b>fish guts</b>. Since it is a pictograph of a fishhook, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word.",
