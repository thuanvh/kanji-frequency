  "heisigStory": "To associate the <b>peach tree</b> with the primitive for a <i>portent</i>, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the <b>Peach</b> Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant <b>peach</b>, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named <b>Peach</b> Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also <i>portended</i> great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the <i>tree</i> that is associated with a <i>portent</i> of coming evil comes to be the <b>peach tree</b>.",
