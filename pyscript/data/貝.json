  "heisigComment": "* When used as a primitive, in addition to <i>shells</i>, the meanings <i>oyster</i> and <i>clam</i> will often come in handy.",
  "heisigStory": "To remember the primitive elements that make up this kanji, an <i>eye</i> and <i>animal legs</i>, you might be tempted to think of it as a pictograph of a <b>shellfish</b> with its ridged shell at the top and two little <i>legs</i> sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish <b>shellfish</b> with a single, gigantic <i>eye</i> roaming the beaches on its slender little <i>legs</i>, scaring the wits out of the sunbathers.",
