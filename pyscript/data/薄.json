  "heisigStory": "Take a good look at this kanji: the \"strong\" element here is really the <i>flower</i>, not the <i>water</i> as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the <i>acupuncturist</i> from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote <b>diluting</b> the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our <i>acupuncturist</i> performing his task with <i>flowers</i> in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe <i>water</i> into the body of the patient.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Note This character belongs to a set of characters which share the flower/water primitive such as:: dilute (#227), fall (#299), clan (#1912), and seaweed (#2035).... (落 薄 藩 藻) It may be helpful to create a primitive keyword for this occurrence (like seaweed or watering can) which can save a lot of time distinguishing them from characters like Sino 満 and Full 満, where the water primitive is larger than the flower primitive.",
