  "heisigStory": "This kanji actually stood for a small <b>measurement</b> used prior to the metric system, a bit over an inch in length, and from there acquired the sense of <b>measurement</b>. In the old system, it was one-<i>tenth</i> of a <i>shaku</i> (whose kanji we shall meet in frame 1151). The picture, appropriately, represents one <i>drop</i> of a <i>ten</i>&nbsp;(with a hook!).",
