  "heisigComment": "* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a <i>dagger</i>. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing <i>saber</i>, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801).",
  "heisigStory": "Although this character no longer looks very much like a <b>sword</b>, it does have some resemblance to the handle of the <b>sword</b>. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us keep make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji.",
