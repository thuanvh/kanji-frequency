  "heisigStory": "To have a <b>dream</b> after going to bed is really the <i>crown</i> to a perfect <i>evening</i>. The <i>flower</i> petals over the <i>eyes</i> (instead of the \"sand\" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant <b>dream</b> suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji.",
