  "koohiiStory1": "Animal track primitive: As expected, animal tracks were left in place of the trail of rice I´d purposely dropped the night before. EDIT - also try the footprint for a primitive meaning, the classic symbol of detective films. STORY: This shakuhachi player is so talented, he can do interpretations of animal noises too. They´re so realistic he soon has animal tracks leading straight to wherever he´s playing.",
  "koohiiStory2": "An interpretive dance of some kind where somebody follows animal tracks, a shakuhachi providing the soundtrack, suggesting the tracker's thoughts and intentions.",
