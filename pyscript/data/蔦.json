  "koohiiStory1": "In the jungle there is a flowery vine called hedera rhombea that attracts humming birds by the dozens. They scoot around the flowers sucking up nectar off the vine.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Note : if you´ll remember we already have a primitive for \"ivy\", but it was completely made up from the \"square jewel\" kanji. The kanji here refers to ivy, or vine, and is used in a particular compound for \"Hedera rhombea\", which is a type of ivy native to Japan. This vine here produces a lot of flowers, and attracts many small birds, which is sure to cheer up even the most depressed Japanese gardener.",
