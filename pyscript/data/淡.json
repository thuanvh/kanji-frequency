  "heisigStory": "The primitives in this kanji read: <i>water</i> . . . <i>inflammation</i>. Taking <i>inflammation</i> in its medical sense, the first <i>water</i>-related <i>inflammation</i> that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very <b>thin</b>. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very <b>thin</b> chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being <i>inflamed</i> with) dehydration (hence the element for <i>water</i>).",
