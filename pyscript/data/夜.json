  "koohiiStory1": "Actually, the lower-right primitive isn´t quite \"walking legs.\" It´s a little more like \"evening\" with an extra stroke across it (look up the stroke order). So, it helps me to see this kanji for night as: evening plus an extra stroke representing the tuxedo tails to match the top hat which my special person is wearing out on the town...",
