  "heisigStory": "Just as the Arabic numeral \"8\" is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for <b>eight</b> is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the \"lazy 8\" is the mathematical symbol for \"infinity,\" so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something \"all-encompassing.\"",
