  "heisigStory": "There are actually a number of kanji for the word <b>I</b>, but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the \"perceiving subject.\" Now the one place in our bodies that all <i>five</i> senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than <i>five mouths</i>: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, <i>five mouths</i> = <b>I</b>.",
