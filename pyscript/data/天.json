  "heisigComment": "* The primitive can mean either the <i>heaven</i> of eternal bliss or the general term for sky, the <i>heavens</i>. Pay special attention to the fact that in its primitive form the first stroke is written right to left, rather like the first stroke of thousand (Frame 40), rather than left to right. From the next character, we shall give it the primitive meaning of a <i>witch</i>.",
  "heisigStory": "This character is meant to be a pictograph of a great man, said to represent the Lord of the <b>Heavens</b>. (You may, of course, use the elements <i>ceiling</i> and <i>St. Bernard</i> instead.)",

  "koohiiStory1": "If you think of the sky as a ceiling above our heads, here you have the heavens as the largest ceiling you could ever imagine. As Heisig pointed out, nothing comes above the ceiling primitive thus the order of primitives is taken care of.",
  "koohiiStory2": "The ceiling that all large dogs aspire to go to is known as heaven. After all, All Dogs Go to Heaven.",
