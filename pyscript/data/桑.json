  "koohiiStory2": "Imagine kids all over the top of a mulberry tree, sitting astride limbs so that their weight is on their crotches. (Mulberry trees have big sprawling limbs that run horizontally or at shallow angles making them easy to climb and sit in. I have an old mulberry in my yard, and my kids are in it constantly).",
