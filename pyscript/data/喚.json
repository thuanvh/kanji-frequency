  "heisigStory": "The <i>mouth</i> on the left is obvious. The rest is harder. Try this: <i>four St. Bernard dogs bound up</i> in a bunch. Together they should supply a clear enough portrait of a <b>yell</b>, provided you are careful to see all <i>four</i> of them. Note how the final stroke of the <i>four</i> is supplied by the long horizontal stroke of the <i>St .Bernard</i>.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Yell? You mean, Old Yeller. Here, we see four St Bernard dogs all yelling for a chance to play a part in Old Yeller. They´re so loud that you have to bound them, and their mouths, up.",
