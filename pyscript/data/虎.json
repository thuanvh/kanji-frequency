  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive element itself, the <i>human legs</i> are also swallowed up, but the meaning of <i>tiger</i> is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the <i>tiger</i> something else to eat.",
  "heisigStory": "The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the <i>magic wand</i>) who decided to make a <b>tiger</b>. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (<i>diced</i> into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated <b><i>tiger</i></b> promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless <i>human legs</i>). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for <i>zoo</i>.",

A wizard who turns people he doesn´t like into newts with his magic wand goes for variety - he has always wanted a tiger pelt - but things go awry when the tiger promptly dices and eats him, leaving only a pair of legs. (a fitting end for a wicked wizard).",
  "koohiiStory2": "Tigger, the tiger, (from Pooh stories) is happy to have found a magic wand. Using it he can bounce up to a the top of a cliff, seven times as high as some human legs could bounce. Tigger thinks \"Its great to be a tiger!",
