  "heisigStory": "The <b>stocks</b> bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy <i>tree</i>, in which one takes \"<b>stock</b>\" in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more <i>trees</i> like itself. Usually good <b>stocks</b> are referred to as \"blue chip,\" but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color <i>vermilion</i>, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Ideally, one buys stocks when a company is young, \"green,\" and rapidly growing -- then sells them just before the last vermillion leaf falls off, and a period of dormancy or limited growth begins.",
