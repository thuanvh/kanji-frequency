  "heisigStory": "The <b>tags</b> you see hanging on <i>trees</i> in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of <i>trees</i> they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the <b>tag</b> to the branch as a large <i>fishhook</i>. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Might be good to note that this is also the Kanji for \"Paper Money\" w/ the reading さつ (千円札＝1000 Yen paper bill)... It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 (\"trump\" playing cards). For the tag meaning I like to think of wooden tags hung on hooks from trees... but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to \"hook you in\" so to speak.",
