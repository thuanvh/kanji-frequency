  "heisigStory": "This kanji is a pictograph of a small wicker basket. (The extra short stroke in the middle helps keep it distinct from the character for <i>twenty</i>.) All one needs to add is some image of <b>sweet</b> cakes or breads carried in the basket, and the union of picture and meaning is complete. Take care not to confuse with <i>confectionary</i> (Frame 1203).",
