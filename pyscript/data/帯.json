  "koohiiStory1": "First, note that the top half of the kanji consists of one and mountain. Of course, the \"number 1\" mountain in Japan is Mt. Fuji. The bottom half, under Mt. Fuji, consists of crown and towel. Now for the story. Archaeologists digging under Mt. Fuji (Japan´s #1 mountain) in an ancient royal tomb (they know it´s royal because of the crown) discover what looks like a towel, but after they clean it up, they see it is actually a splendid royal sash for the king´s kimono.",
  "koohiiStory2": "Beautiful \"Miss Housewife Japan\" is on posters everywhere, cooking right before Mt. Fuji (the number one mountain) while wearing nothing but her crown, and an apron tied with a sash. (hodgepodge of mspertus, zwarte_kat, et al, with a jot of hadaka apron to focus the image.).",
