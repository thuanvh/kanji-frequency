  "koohiiStory2": "For the condor primitive: A condor is like a vulture, but twice as big and it lives near mountains (a suitable place for such a majestic bird). For swing: I´m sitting on a swing when a condor comes by and picks up the whole swing set with its big finger-like claws and now I´m swinging in mid-air. Weeeeeeeee!!!!!",
