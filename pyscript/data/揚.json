  "koohiiStory2": "Picture a major robbery where some dudes are breaking into a bank to steal their money. They get their man in the vault through the ceiling - now he´s hanging from a rope a few feet from the ground (like in the movies, dodging laser beams). He reports back that he has found the loot, and its all in a large piggy bank in the center of the vault. The alarm sounds and he´s got to think fast. He jams the four fingers of his right hand in the piggy bank slot and tells his team to hoist him up, he´s got the loot!",
