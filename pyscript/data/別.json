  "heisigStory": "In the Old East, the samurai and his <i>saber</i> were never <b>separated</b>. They were constant companions, like the cowboy of the Old West and his six-shooter. This character depicts what must have been the height of <b>separation</b>-anxiety for a samurai: to be <i>bound up with a rope</i> and unable to get at his <i>saber</i> leaning only a few feet away from him. Look at that <i>mouth</i> bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for <i>tied up</i> is written - just as it had been with the character for <i>ten thousand</i>.",
