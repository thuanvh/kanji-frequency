  "koohiiStory1": "Long ago our ancestors set aside the use of fingers and began to use cutlery. (Raichu,11-7-2006) The way I remember it´s 昔 once upon a time (#1184) rather than 旧 olden times (#35) is that they began to use cutlery to eat salad. (I also think about how when you visit the Medieval Times theme park, which is set in Once upon a time, their gimmick is that you eat with your fingers.).",
  "koohiiStory2": "Once upon a time... Oh hell, you´re just too old for this. You close your fairy tale book and set it aside, pushing it away with your fingers.",
