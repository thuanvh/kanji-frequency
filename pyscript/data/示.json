  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive, this kanji means <i>altar</i>. At the left, the abbreviated form that this element takes is made by chopping the <i>altar</i> in half and leaving only one dot behind to represent the right side. The new appearance of this primitive form, ネ, should be kept distinct from that for <i>cloak</i>, identical except for the one final short stroke.",
  "heisigStory": "Although the elements <i>two</i> and <i>little</i> are available for the using, it may be easier to remember this character as a picture of an altar. Something placed atop the altar is put on <b>show</b> for all to see.",
