  "koohiiStory1": "A colleague implies someone that you share work with, such as in your company or profession, etc. Here your colleague helps you to erect your pup tent during a company outing. Note: Heisig's warning to keep this distinct from other similiar kanji such as companion (#19), friend (#704), consort (#1203) and comrade (#1637). That is why I chose to have the person element pictured as someone (the colleague in this case) helping with the work of building the pup tent.",

As he sees that his colleague accept to do some extra work during the week-end and even sleep at the office, he says to them: \"I pity da fool who work during week-end! You might as well install a pup tent in the office and forget about your home\".",
