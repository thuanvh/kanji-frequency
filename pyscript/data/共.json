  "heisigComment": "* The primitive retains the meaning of <i>together</i>. Imagine things <i>strung together</i> like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with <i>bushel basket</i>, this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure.",
