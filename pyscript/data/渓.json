  "koohiiStory2": "A husband who went fishing at the mountain stream to feed his family, fell in the rapids (we´ll assume this is a large mountain stream). He is saved from the waters by a great eagle. He comes back home with nothing to feed the family, his clothes still dripping wet as he tells his wife of how he was saved by a great eagle, and of course she does not believe him. The story continues in chicken (#1947).",
