  "heisigStory": "The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for <i>part of the body</i>, and on the right, the character for <i>nightbreak</i>, which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the <b>gall bladder</b> is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the <b>gall bladder</b> is supposed to filter out), and change it to \"not letting the <i>night break</i> on your anger\" (or your <b>gall</b>) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then \"sleeping it off.\"",
