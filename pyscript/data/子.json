  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive, the meaning of <i>child</i> is retained, though you might imagine a little older <i>child</i>, able to run around and get into more mischief.",
  "heisigStory": "This kanji is a pictograph of a <b>child</b> wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young <b>children</b> who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck.",
