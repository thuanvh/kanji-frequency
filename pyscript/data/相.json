  "heisigStory": "The prefix <b>inter-</b> stirs up associations of cooperation among people. From there we read off the elements: <i>tree</i> . . . <i>eye</i>. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one's own <i>eye</i> before helping your neighbors with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for <b>inter-</b>human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji!",
