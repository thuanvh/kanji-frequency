  "koohiiStory1": "(Think rpg!) We were in dire need of healing. Our party was fighting the cavemen, but we didn't fare too well. It was more like a butcher's meeting than a fight... just as they were about to pierce my heart, luckily a priest came along and used his healing spell in the nick of time (#2433).",
  "koohiiStory2": "Note: meeting of butchers + heart are later combined into 愈 in the nick of time (#2433). Story: For healing to take place, you must catch the sickness in the nick of time.",
