  "heisigComment": "* As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a <i>fat man</i>. Think of a grotesquely <i>fat man</i> whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a <i>round baseball player</i> becomes a <i>fat man</i>.",
  "heisigStory": "We speak of \"<b>round</b> numbers,\" or \"<b>rounding</b> a number off,\" meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest <i>drop</i>, to <i>nine</i>, you end up with a <b>round</b> number.",

  "koohiiStory2": "Watch out for plump (#120). Here Heisig could have added a \"t\" and we would have had a much better keyword : rotund. Rotund is more specific than \"round\" which begs for confusion with circle (#1811). A dictionary search on \"fat\" or \"round\" doesn´t yield this kanji, but \"rotund\" does! Primitive suggestion: the Laughing Buddha is often depicted as a rotund, smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude).",
