  "koohiiStory2": "I think BALANCE is an easier keyword. I was walking down a busy French boulevard when between the rushing traffic I saw the wierdest thing. BALANCING on the central crash barrier was a St. Bernard dog, BALANCING a fish on its nose. As I looked closer, I realised it was a trick; it was holding the fish´s tail in its teeth, and only pretending to BALANCE it. (keeps the position of the elements!).",
