  "heisigComment": "* The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive; otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word \"every,\" which we shall meet later in another context.",
  "heisigStory": "\"Suum cuique\" goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her <i>mouth</i> between his/her <i>walking legs</i>, giving us an image of \"To <b>each</b> his/her own.\"",
