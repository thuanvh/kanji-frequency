  "heisigStory": "Probably the one thing most <i>children</i> fear more than anything else is the dentist's chair. Once a <i>child</i> has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word <b>cavity</b>, even though it is not likely to know that the word means \"hole\" until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny <i>hooks</i> the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back.",
