  "heisigStory": "The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality; hence we refer to it as \"<b>sort of thing</b>.\" Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an <i>oven flame</i> with the <i>flesh</i> of a <i>chihuahua</i> being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a \"hot-diggity, dog-diggity\" <b>sort of thing</b>.",

Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr´s. Thanks!).",
