  "heisigStory": "This kanji also uses the full form of <i>water</i>, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with <i>water</i>. Remember what William Blake said about seeing \"infinity in a grain of sand and <b>eternity</b> in an hour\"? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see \"<b>eternity</b> in a <i>drop of water</i>.\"",

(In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).",
