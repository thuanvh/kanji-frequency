  "koohiiStory1": "I have created the element \"old camera\" out of the left side of the kanji: from the subject´s point of view, the light is captured by one mouth (the lens). The photographer is under a big hood, we only see his legs, and he is holding a spike in his right hand, which is the shutter release. Now, at the time the photographer takes the photo, a little insect is flying near the flash. The flash is so powerful that the insect is burnt and dissolves in the air.",
  "koohiiStory2": "I´ve seen this crazy thing with only one mouth that can dissolve up to 4 nails and an insect at the same time. Sweet! (It´s a venus flytrap, btw).",
