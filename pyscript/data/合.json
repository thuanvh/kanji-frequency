  "heisigStory": "The kanji for <b>fit</b> reads literally, top to bottom, as a <i>meeting</i> of <i>mouths</i>&nbsp;- which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people's ideas don't <b>fit</b>&nbsp;with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what would happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose <i>mouths</i> didn't <b>fit</b>.",
