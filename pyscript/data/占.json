  "heisigStory": "This is one of those kanji that is a real joy of simplicity: a <i>divining rod</i> with a <i>mouth</i>&nbsp;- which translate directly into <b>fortune-telling</b>. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first <i>divining rod</i>, then <i>mouth</i>. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do.",
