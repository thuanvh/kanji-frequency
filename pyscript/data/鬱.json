  "heisigStory": "Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from <i>melancholy</i> (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material <i>depression</i> we met in Frame 1421).<div>The picture of <b>gloom</b> begins with a small <i>grove</i> of trees, under which we see a <i>crown</i> made out of used <i>tin cans</i>. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of <i>Remembering the Kanji</i>. It is composed of a <i>shovel</i> with a <i>sheaf</i> dotted with small <i>drops</i> on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop <i>shovel</i> attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪ \"Bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>, bulldozing in the <i>sheaves</i>...\" ♪ The <i>drops</i> represent the chaff flying about as the <i>sheaves</i> are tossed about by the heavy machinery.</div><div>There is <i>someone sitting on the ground</i> alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your <i>tin-can crown</i>. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro-business draws closer and closer to the <i>grove</i>, the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re-<i>shaping</i> of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of <b>gloom</b> down upon you.</div><div>A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.</div>",

  "koohiiStory1": "The pixie, wearing a tin can crown, watches from the middle of the grove, the sparkling villain approach. She sits down in gloom wondering if she belongs amongst the trees, for she has never seen such a beautiful shape.",
  "koohiiStory2": "The context of gloom here refers to an environmental disaster that humans make. The story begins at a GROVE with TIN CANS shaped like CROWNS which are really soda cans. They belonged to workers who bulldozes (or SHOVELS) lots and lots of SHEAVES with DROPS of its pieces. Afar, a boy is SITTING while watching the workers reSHAPING the environment. His face now has a very gloomy expression.",
