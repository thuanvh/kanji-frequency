  "heisigStory": "What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning \"everywhere\" or \"heaps of\" was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see <i>two suns</i>, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the <i>three suns</i> of <i>sparkle</i>. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of <b>prosperous</b> times as <i>sunny</i>, what could be more <b>prosperous</b> than a sky with <i>two suns</i> in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there.",

  "koohiiStory2": "I kept getting this mixed up with meanings like ´fortune´, so here is a fool proof story! Remember the Vulcan salute from ´Star Trek´ (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase ´live long and PROSPER´? If that´s not enough of a visual reminder, the Vulcan salute shows the fingers parted in to 2 sets of 2, and visually kind of looks like this kanji if you think about it.",
