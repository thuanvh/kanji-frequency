While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something \"very, very tiny.\" The kanji shows a <i>cliff</i> with a <i>computer</i> under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing.

The only odd thing about this kanji is that the <i>soil</i> comes UNDER the <i>graveyard</i>, rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as \"lying under boot-hill\" if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji.",

Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for <i>zoo</i>.",
